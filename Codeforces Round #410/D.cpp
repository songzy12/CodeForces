// Sort the boxes in increasing number of oranges. Count the total number of apples in boxes with odd and even numbers. If the boxes with odd numbers contain at least half of all apples, choose them (there are exactly N boxes with odd numbers). If the boxes with even numbers contain at least half of all apples, take them and the last box (which contains the largest number of oranges). It's easy to see that in both cases the conditions of the task are fulfilled.
